Summary

Naresh Sanchana initiated a feature design review covering the "browse all  
programs" feature, which Palak Varma explained was intended to make the  
entire catalog visible within the platform, and Fann Saw's design for a new  
journal feature. Vishen Lakhiani proposed a strategic pivot to a  
new "Program Intelligences" application, demonstrating a prototype that  
integrates programs with user goals and is designed to automate Mind  
Valley's website and business processes, suggesting a fast rebuild of Mind  
Valley Home on this system. Norman Noble and Vishen Lakhiani discussed the  
complexities of rebuilding the legacy platform, agreeing instead to pursue  
a parallel development strategy where Program Intelligences is an  
adjacent "sandbox" for rapid feature development, with Vishen Lakhiani also  
advocating for building the new journal feature within this AI-compatible  
system despite Dario Bianchi's concern about immediate deployment on the  
current platform for retention.


Suggested next steps


Fann Saw will send Vishen Lakhiani the Figma for the journal designs and  
provide edit rights to the Figma.

Fann Saw will design and prepare a web version of the journal feature using  
SHA's CSS, and send Vishen Lakhiani a transcript of her thoughts, feelings,  
and ideas on how the journal app should work and feel for Claude Code to  
process.

Naresh Sanchana will play around with the program intelligence platform and  
ask any questions on how to take this further.
