Summary


Vishen Lakhiani requested postponing the customer release of program  
intelligence by a month due to the product's immaturity and development  
issues, including a lack of Docker usage and improper GitHub practices,  
despite Naresh Sanchana having a rollout plan and a list of 10,000 active  
Mind Valley customers for access. Vishen Lakhiani and Dario Bianchi agreed  
to prioritize building the program intelligence for staff first, with Dario  
Bianchi assigning Syamsul MJ (Sam) to provide engineering support and set  
up a proper workflow, including resolving GitHub merge conflicts and  
configuring Docker usage. Vishen Lakhiani, Rafay Korai, and Shafiu Hussain  
discussed developing intelligent pathways using lesson-level summaries and  
integrating program intelligence with Story Block for automated page  
publishing, while Fariz Salleh demonstrated the Air Table Asset Sync  
feature, which needs troubleshooting before merging.


Suggested next steps


Norman Noble will try to find time to teach Vishen Lakhiani, Rafé, and  
Daniel the proper protocol for Git and to sort out the issues they are  
having with GitHub.

Syamsul MJ (Sam) will review Vishen Lakhiani's PR requests for program  
intelligence and check the remote branches to ensure they are clean and  
healthy.

Syamsul MJ (Sam) will get familiar with the program intelligence code,  
process, and tools, and then onboard Vishen Lakhiani on the GitHub workflow  
and Docker setup.

Dario Bianchi will set up the right team for program intelligence and  
structure the project.

The group will go through a training session on Git to understand the  
process and solve the ongoing problems.

Shafiu Hussain will show Vishen Lakhiani how to switch the branch and run  
dev to see the code on local.

Vishen Lakhiani will create a meeting for program intelligence weekly sync  
every Tuesday and add Syamsul MJ (Sam), Fariz Salleh, Rafay Korai, and  
Daniel Sabo.

Fariz Salleh will troubleshoot and reach out to Syamsul MJ (Sam) after  
doing a git pull from the main branch regarding merging his code.

Shafiu Hussain will create a claude skill to turn the program intelligence  
summary and images into a Mind Valley sales page.

Vishen Lakhiani will add an author management section, including the author  
table, and pull author data from Mind Valley Brain, using a link to the air  
table from Fariz Salleh.

Rafay Korai will set up a meeting with Marishia to decide on the Mindset  
pathway.

Rafay Korai will make the 2026 pathway data collaborative, and update the  
unified brain information in program intelligence regarding program  
classification and pathways, to build the pathway collections and sell them  
instead of full membership.

Shafiu Hussain, Fariz Salleh, and Rafay Korai will set up a time to sync  
with Abi Abishek on connecting program intelligence to Storyblok to create  
visual pages.
