Summary


Conversion Rate Strategy Focus
Due to declining conversion rates, an external consultant specializing in  
high-ticket product events is being brought in, starting with the AI  
Summit, to restructure the event design and improve financial outcomes.

Launch Timing and Systemic Issues
Major concern was raised about Vision's simultaneous commitment to another  
event during the $7 million AI Summit launch, leading to a discussion about  
program timing and the need for standardized systems to avoid rushed,  
commercially weak launches.

Implement Commercial Feasibility Workflow
The team agreed to restructure the workflow by implementing a commercial  
feasibility checkpoint prior to curriculum development, including  
conducting market research for all future programs annually to inform  
strategic decision-making and project prioritization.


Suggested next steps


Jaideep Chagger will work on a structure to build a financial feasibility  
report for potential masteries until Connie returns.

Jaideep Chagger will formulate the meeting notes and share the format in  
the meeting room.

Janja will help build an ongoing agenda for the next meeting.

Jaideep Chagger will present the commercial of the rest of the programs  
next week.
