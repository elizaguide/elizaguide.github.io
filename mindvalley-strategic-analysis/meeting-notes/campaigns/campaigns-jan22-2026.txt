Summary


Vishen Lakhiani directed Jaideep Chagger to consolidate all AI-related  
files into a single AI mastery Air Table, stressing the importance of  
proper data organization, file formatting (CSV for raw data, TXT for  
scripts), and secure data management by excluding sensitive information  
like email addresses. Vishen Lakhiani, Jaideep Chagger, Glen Jason Chittur,  
and Ramya Rednam worked on structuring the Air Table with fields such  
as "Description," "Doc Type," and an auto number for survey data, while  
also addressing copy concerns for the webinar banner and defining the  
content and deliverables for the AI Clone Accelerator focused on building  
an AI clone system. Furthermore, Vishen Lakhiani and Jaideep Chagger  
outlined the AI Clone Accelerator model and pricing strategy, with a  
proposed accelerator price of $997 or $999 and innovative time-based price  
increases, and discussed speaker selection for the event, including  
Dominic, Iman, and potentially Dave Kate.


Suggested next steps


Jaideep Chagger will kill the current air table and move all data,  
including AI accelerator survey results and AI summit survey results, into  
the existing AI mastery air table, ensuring all relevant links are included.

Jaideep Chagger will align with Rhythm and Yani to clean up and improve the  
existing AI mastery air table instead of building a new one.

Jaideep Chagger will refine the data organization process, ensuring Yana  
works to have all data sorted out well in advance of future meetings.

Jaideep Chagger will add the survey description in the air table and ensure  
the data files are in CSV format for raw data and text format for survey  
questions, including an auto number field, while excluding email addresses  
for security reasons.

Glen Jason Chittur will convert the content of the Google Doc into a single  
txt file and upload it into attachments, including video scripts and the  
campaign AI accelerator webinar key message.

Glen Jason Chittur will run all the scripts on Claude to come up with the  
refined script for Vishen Lakhiani to show the next day.

Vishen Lakhiani will send the Tony Robbins documents to Jaideep Chagger.

Vishen Lakhiani will share the rough proposal of the agenda with Iman to  
see if Iman is open to teaching at the AI clone accelerator on February 6th  
and 7th.

Jaideep Chagger will refine the curriculum and the webinar script based on  
Vishen Lakhiani's input and critique, and send it to Vishen Lakhiani  
tomorrow for final decision.

Vishen Lakhiani will film the required videos, including the invite video  
and the video about cloning, tomorrow on Friday after the strategy meeting.

Glen Jason Chittur will put the filmed videos into production and publish  
them on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Vishen Lakhiani will leave a message for Dave Kate to invite him to speak  
and teach something at the weekend AI event on building an AI clone to  
optimize business.

Jaideep Chagger will send Vishen Lakhiani a summary of the agenda to  
forward to Dave Kate to ask which areas he wants to teach.

Jaideep Chagger and Jennif will work on a proposal to restructure AI  
mastery and send it to Barry.

Jaideep Chagger will ensure that the Air Table documents are well adjusted  
going forward.

Jaideep Chagger will follow up with Enie and the group will get on a call  
with Barry.
