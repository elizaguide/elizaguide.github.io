Summary


AI Voice and URL Structure
The team needs to tag the AI to ensure all generated content adopts the  
specific voice of the organization; furthermore, the current URL structure  
for the CLC seminar landing page was deemed unacceptable due to its length  
and difficulty in sharing.

Seminar Strategy and Team Onboarding
The CLC seminar's strategy focuses on human engagement and  
being "indestructible" to indirectly lead participants toward coaching,  
aligning with the 2026 playbook. Concerns were raised regarding the slow  
onboarding of a new hire, with the decision made that immediate meeting  
immersion is critical to alleviate team workload pressure.

AI Refinement and Launch Postponement
The leadership decided to leverage Eliza and Claude Code to refine the  
seminar's hook and campaign design using prioritized performance data. Due  
to identified flaws on the landing page, the team agreed to postpone the  
email and ad traffic launch until the necessary page improvements are  
completed.


Suggested next steps


Jaideep Chagger will book a follow-up meeting with Vishen Lakhiani to  
fine-tune the CLC project and sync on the page updates during the daily  
huddle tomorrow.

The group will postpone sending the CLC email that was planned for today  
until tomorrow due to issues with the landing page.

Jaideep Chagger, Ramya Rednam, and Marisha Lakhiani will ensure the new  
hire is included in every call moving forward to facilitate their  
onboarding and learning.

The group will ensure that all URLs are set to a single word for Mind  
Valley pages, like mindbal.com/clone, which can be a redirect.

The group will stick to using photos only from Vishen Lakhiani's correct  
photo folder and ensure the design team does not use random, unapproved  
pictures.

The group will change the image used for Nick on the banner of the website  
to one that does not initially show his malformed hand, reserving the image  
showing his authenticity for when people scroll down.

The group will convert the live seminar 2026 XLSS file to CSV format so  
Claude can properly read and utilize the data for the campaign design  
project.
