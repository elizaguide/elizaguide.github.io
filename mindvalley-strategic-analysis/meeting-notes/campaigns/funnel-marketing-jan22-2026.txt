Summary


Titus Thana Raj introduced a "brick library" of pre-existing content for  
rapid video creation, which Matt Coates, Titus Thana Raj, and Charles Cox  
agreed to use immediately for testing, emphasizing the priority of quick  
deployment over extensive planning. Participants including Shubham Semwal,  
Kristin Hollmann, Harri Vishnu Aravinnashan, and Mohammad Saad presented  
numerous ideas for new hooks and content focused on specific outcomes,  
while Matt Coates provided critical feedback on the proposed CTAs and  
hooks, noting that they often lacked directness and required innovation in  
delivery. Key strategic next steps include Titus Thana Raj's team starting  
video editing based on shared briefs, Daniel Savov requesting the  
documentation of creative ideas in AirTable, and Matt Coates outlining a  
strategy for creating longer "hero assets" structured as VSSLs and  
prioritizing the "Amplify with AI" outcome pathway for new content creation.


Suggested next steps


Titus Thana Raj will share the document containing the 'brick library' with  
the group so they can mix and match components to create different flows  
for videos.

Titus Thana Raj will have a separate meeting with Estrella Chan and the  
group to shortlist video ideas and decide which ones to pursue from the  
shared document.

Matt Coates will prioritize the creation of longer, outcome-related pieces  
of content (like a 7 to 10 minute VSSL, but not a pure script) that  
integrate several of the identified hooks and CTAs for submission to film.

Matt Coates will go through the Figma and create three different  
outcome-based filming documents for Vision, possibly as a script.

Titus Thana Raj will get his team to edit videos using the existing briefs  
and show the results during the Tuesday creative sync meeting.

Titus Thana Raj will check the script to find additional snippets for the  
videos.

Harri Vishnu Aravinnashan will talk to Far and Nelo from the design team to  
determine the page design and ensure the copy for the 'Amplify with AI'  
outcome is ready, including the headline, subheadline, and a pain section  
at the top.
