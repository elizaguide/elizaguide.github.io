Summary


Shift to Outcome-Specific Advertising
The team needs to transition advertising efforts to be outcome-specific for  
effective learning and strategy execution, requiring new creative and  
landing pages that are currently pending. They established a phased user  
journey from cold masterclass assets to retargeting focused on selling the  
high-value 'Collection' product.

Standardized Data for AI Training
A critical need was identified for organizing program data, including  
transcripts and survey results, into standardized AirTable structures with  
MD files to efficiently train the Claude AI. This data organization will  
enable Program Intelligence to quickly draft masterclass scripts and other  
assets based on Mind Valley's methodology.

Silva Masterclass Asset Prioritization
The team decided to focus exclusively on creating and filming the Silva  
Masterclass assets by February 3rd to generate necessary advertising  
content. AI tools were utilized to quickly draft the webinar script and  
slides, prioritizing asset generation over a polished live event.


Suggested next steps


Charles Cox will add Rafay Korai and the group to the retargeting call next  
week.

Vishen Lakhiani will try to find the claude files on their computer and add  
them to a new masterclass thing for sharing.

Vishen Lakhiani will send the MD file containing their analyzed Instagram  
writing style to Matt Coates so he can put anything in their voice.

Rafay Korai will download the CSV files for the Silva data and prepare it  
for use with Claude.

Matt Coates will go into the masterclass script and make sure that  
everything is accurate before filming.

The group will start using the Silver Ultramine files and Masterclass  
Creator to build Silva's masterclass.

Rafay Korai will make Vishen Lakhiani an admin of the pathways WhatsApp  
group and check with Ramy regarding the scheduling of the Silva Masterclass  
on the 3rd of Feb and update Vishen Lakhiani's calendar.

Shubham Semwal will share the script, raw docs, ads, and all necessary  
documents, including the full quest lesson transcript and a CSV of all  
leads from the air table, for the Silva Ultra Mind webinar with Vishen  
Lakhiani by tomorrow.

Shubham Semwal will book a one-hour call for Matt Coates, Harri Vishnu  
Aravinnashan, and Titus Thana Raj tomorrow at 11:00 AM to generate the  
final script for the Silva Ultra Mind webinar, including preparing hooks,  
leads, and slides using Claude.

Rafay Korai will process all quest transcripts on the code level and also  
ask the system to produce an MD file, creating a field where the MD file  
can be downloaded right away.

Matt Coates will take the long masterclass script document and rewrite it  
in Vishen Lakhiani's voice using Claude and the MD file.

Shubham Semwal will send a summary of all the documents needed for the  
Silva Ultra Mind webinar to the WhatsApp group.

Vishen Lakhiani will buy a studio mic for the masterclass filming setup.

Vishen Lakhiani will trash the study buddy custom notes branch and rebuild
