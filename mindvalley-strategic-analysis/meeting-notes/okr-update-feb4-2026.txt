Summary


New AI-Integrated OKR System
The meeting commenced with an overview of the key logistical and  
connectivity challenges of the previous two-system OKR structure, leading  
to the introduction of a new AI-integrated OKR model designed to enhance  
goal clarity and contribution visibility.

Aligning Structure and Financials
A significant portion of the discussion focused on accurately defining  
business units, aligning product classifications, and ensuring the new  
structure harmonizes with existing financial reporting systems for accurate  
business reporting and profitability tracking.

OKR System Becomes Single Source
The primary point of the meeting centered on clarifying that primary  
metrics must be those that teams own and are accountable for, while  
confirming that the new OKR system will become the single source of truth  
for goals, replacing Bamboo HR for goal tracking.


Suggested next steps


Rafay Korai will book a separate chat with Jill Tan on Friday at 2:00 pm to  
discuss the finance source of truth and aligning on the business unit  
structure and profitability reporting.

Rafay Korai will add any missing departments and feed that to the AI to  
ensure the right source of truth is maintained.

Rafay Korai will add business units and team members to the 'team members'  
tab with the help of AI.

Melissa Dookie will figure out a way to sync the new OKR system with  
BambooHR to avoid duplication.

Moniek van Waaijenburg and Rafay Korai will optimize the new system based  
on any more questions or feedback.

Melissa Dookie and Moniek van Waaijenburg will sync with Rafay Korai to  
update the team names and people on the list if there are corrections.

Rafay Korai will make it clear for the group how to perform the next step.
