Summary

The meeting, with participants including Jaideep Chagger, Conny Marquez  
Fajardo, Jill Tan, Rafay Korai, Alex Dogliotti, Vishen Lakhiani, Ramya  
Rednam, Marisha Lakhiani, and Moniek van Waaijenburg, covered a review of  
December 2025 performance, 2026 strategies, and data accuracy. Jill Tan  
reported that 2025 revenue reached $108.5 million, exceeding the target,  
with December sales at $7.9 million, while the 2026 target is set at $128.1  
million with a $40.5 million ad spend budget. Conny Marquez Fajardo  
reported that Premium Programs achieved $34.6 million in 2025, driven by  
Mastery growth, and aims for $45.9 million in 2026, while Jaideep Chagger  
updated on the "spiritual challenge" generating $480K and the successful  
social media summit with 101.3K leads. Vishen Lakhiani raised concerns  
about double counting in metabase dashboards regarding mastery sales,  
requested the display of actual net revenue and customers, and strongly  
recommended promoting Ramya Rednam to lead campaigns holistically.


Suggested next steps


Jaideep Chagger will cross-check the dates for CLC and CBC on the website  
to ensure they are updated to Jan and Feb.

Jaideep Chagger will align with Conny Marquez Fajardo in the coming week  
regarding live coaching preparation as they are less than a month away from  
going live.
