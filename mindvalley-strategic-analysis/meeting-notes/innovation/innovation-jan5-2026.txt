Summary

Mohamed Maail Rasheed provided a demo of Vibrantly web, with Vishen  
Lakhiani and Norman Noble suggesting using Vishen Lakhiani's actual blood  
work data for testing; Norman Noble and Dario Bianchi were updated by  
Vishen Lakhiani on their experimental projects like "Eliza" and  
the "Intelligence Engine" concept, which includes the integration of Six  
and Vibrantly. Norman Noble raised concerns about sequencing multiple apps,  
while Vishen Lakhiani set a January 29 deadline for Bruno Azenha Goncalves  
to have a working demo of Six ready for a founder's dinner, and Dario  
Bianchi agreed to set up customer interviews for Vibrantly to validate the  
product direction before payment and sales are added. Vishen Lakhiani  
confirmed that Six, Vibrantly, and other experimental projects are being  
built under a new entity in Dubai to protect assets and serve as a  
marketplace, with Norman Noble committing to determine a realistic scope  
for a demo of the full ecosystem, including the community aspect (Six),  
requested by Vishen Lakhiani for Gary Brea by the end of the month.


Suggested next steps


Bruno Azenha Goncalves will deliver a working demo of six for the London  
Founders Society, including the ability to share resources and see  
profiles, by January 29.

Norman Noble will work out what can be realistically achieved for the  
Vibrantly demo by the end of the month and communicate it.

Dario Bianchi will set up customer interviews with Ahmed Amanulla (Aman)  
and Sha to show Vibrantly and get feedback.

Norman Noble will send Vishen Lakhiani the exact command to use with Claude  
to fix the high-priority security issues in the Program Intelligence  
project.

Dario Bianchi and Norman Noble will prepare a presentation on how to  
implement the forking of the company to a new entity for the strategy  
meeting in three weeks.
