Summary


Bruno Azenha Goncalves and Shafiu Hussain discussed setting up the domain  
for "vibrantly," likely **vibrantly.com**, and the preference for  
authentication emails to come from their own domain, though they are  
currently believed to be on Mine Valley. Dario Bianchi outlined the agenda,  
including an update on "vibrancy" and naming, and Justine Ausha Smith asked  
Dario Bianchi and Shafiu Hussain about the rebranding of the "six app" and  
domain selection, which they were unaware of. There was a brief discussion  
about Vish's availability and location, with Norman Noble and Dario Bianchi  
mentioning Spain and France as possibilities, and Justine Ausha Smith and  
Bruno Azenha Goncalves providing recent updates on Vish's location. Norman  
Noble corrected a typo in a message from "Ashraf" to "Iskandar," and Dario  
Bianchi shared an update that Iskandar would be back on Wednesday  
after "titly manifesting mastery." Dario Bianchi suggested staying on the  
call with Justine Ausha Smith and Bruno Azenha Goncalves to shape the  
premium program discussion and close other analysis before Iskandar's  
return.


Suggested next steps


Dario Bianchi will send a message to Shamas or Kim to get more details  
about the rebranding of six.

Norman Noble will correct the typo in the message where he mistakenly  
mentioned Ashraf instead of Kandar.
