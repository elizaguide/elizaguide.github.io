Summary


Food Features and Chat Priority
The team reviewed the current build, confirming the initial focus would be  
on developing the food features before moving on to supplements. A key  
architectural decision was made to prioritize a conversational, chat-based  
interface over the current complex medical dashboard approach.

UX and Typography Adjustments
Extensive user experience feedback was provided, including simplifying the  
food logging process to a single action and significantly increasing the  
text size across the application for improved readability for older users.  
The team also addressed the need for image-to-text conversion (OCR) to  
handle scanned lab reports effectively.

Intelligence Engine and Supplement Focus
The Envision Intelligence Engine, which manages application provisioning  
and data scopes, was showcased, allowing multiple applications to access  
synchronized data with explicit user consent. Following the food module,  
the team decided to focus on building the supplement features due to easier  
implementation and correlation with nutritional analysis.


Suggested next steps


Shafiu Hussain will get back to Vishen Lakhiani when the team is ready to  
start building for Blink Life.

Vishen Lakhiani will give Shafiu Hussain and Euson Chew access to the  
supplement air table.

Euson Chew will build a card for the dashboard to show the nine user goals,  
as the user must be able to see their goals.

Euson Chew will create a distinction in the supplement feature  
between 'ingredients' and 'blends' (formulations/stacks) and provide rough  
designs.

Shafiu Hussain and Ahmed Amanulla (Aman) will build a feature similar to  
program intelligence with versioning for system prompts/intelligences for  
Eliza within the Envision interface.

Shafiu Hussain and Ahmed Amanulla (Aman) will rename the food and  
supplements section to 'Meal supplements' on the dashboard.

The group will start building for supplements first instead of workouts.
