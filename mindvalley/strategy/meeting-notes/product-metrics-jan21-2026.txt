Summary


Thomas Yap Meng Tiong opened the product update by highlighting the  
importance of sharing key product metrics with the broader company, while  
Thomas Yap Meng Tiong, Lei Siang Saw, Thivakaran Selvarajoo, Sarah Yeoh,  
and Cheng Yew Ng discussed various performance metrics. Thomas Yap Meng  
Tiong reported higher year-over-year Monthly Active Users and Subscribers  
for January, but noted lower metrics in November and December due to Black  
Friday's influx of "quest only users" who had low engagement, negatively  
impacting the first 15 days on-app metrics. Lei Siang Saw, supported by  
Thivakaran Selvarajoo, observed that checkout traffic had recovered  
post-Black Friday, but conversion rates remained low, partially due to  
reduced traffic from M media, which Thomas Yap Meng Tiong noted was being  
fixed, and Thivakaran Selvarajoo confirmed dedicated affiliate tracking had  
been deployed. Sarah Yeoh and Cheng Yew Ng detailed improvements in  
engagement and transformation, with Weekly Stickiness recovering, the  
year-over-year gap closing, and consumption growth attributed to  
initiatives like the social media summit and fixing standalone meditation  
access logic, with Thomas Yap Meng Tiong emphasizing that the  
tight 'Transform' criterion indicated growing user stickiness. Sarah Yeoh  
also reported on 'If AI' adoption nearing its Q1 target due to a 'Go AI'  
spillover effect, and Lei Siang Saw shared A/B test results on shifting  
password creation pre-upsell, which slightly improved the day zero locking  
rate but significantly decreased the upsell uptake rate, leading Thomas Yap  
Meng Tiong to support further testing to optimize the checkout flow.  
Finally, Sarah Yeoh updated on 'Go AI' rollout, noting positive impacts on  
first 15 days consumption and 'If AI' adoption, a successful rebound in  
free-to-pay conversion after fixing a missing sales page pop-up, and an  
identified drop-off opportunity in the 'Go AI' funnel that warrants planned  
experiments.


Suggested next steps


Lei Siang Saw will run follow-up tests to resolve issues in the day zero  
locking, including putting the skin button on top of the upsell page.
