Summary


Launching New AI-Powered Initiatives
Mind Valley is launching three new companies—Phineminds, Vibrantly, and  
Blink Life—due to rapid AI advancement, requiring the Martekch team to  
pivot their focus to scaling the technology for these new ventures.

Advanced AI Transforms Operations
The advanced Agentic AI, Eliza, was introduced, capable of scriptwriting,  
content analysis, and strategy advising, leading to the projection that 50%  
of current work will be automated within three months.

Strategy Focuses on Hyperpersonalization
The Martekch strategy was reviewed, emphasizing hyperpersonalization and  
data completeness for AI scaling, and the company decided to build a new  
accessible CRM solution integrating data from Brace and Osiris due to  
existing login and profile access challenges.


Suggested next steps


Pavel Luzanov will schedule a meeting next week to take Vishen Lakhiani  
through Brace.

Nicole Chin will message Yana to get the Martekch team on the AI  
accelerator program.

Nicole Chin will continue speaking to Eliza and WhatsApp Vishen Lakhiani  
when finished.

Pavel Luzanov will work with Vishen Lakhiani to build a React and Superbase  
system that can function as a CRM.
