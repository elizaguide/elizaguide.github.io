Summary


Jaideep Chagger, Eni Selfo, and Conny Marquez Fajardo discussed the  
post-summit sales update, which currently stands at $1.26 million, and the  
continuous sales without scarcity; Eni Selfo and Marta reported positive  
speaker feedback, high attendance, and overall satisfaction from the  
summit, though Eni Selfo noted challenges with partnership flexibility and  
simulive engagement. Conny Marquez Fajardo, Jaideep Chagger, Eni Selfo,  
Francesca Facio Crespo, Janja, and Tom Kirby agreed to improve sales pitch  
preparation and a new strategy to address pricing objections by  
commercializing the three modules (Creator Blueprint, Visibility  
Accelerator, and Monetization Engine) separately for $1999 (non-members)  
and $1499 (members), with Janja and Tom Kirby confirming the necessary  
platform and product adjustments. Eni Selfo, Jaideep Chagger, Conny Marquez  
Fajardo, Tom Kirby, and Francesca Facio Crespo also planned the AI Mastery  
summit for March 6-8, considering an upgraded virtual production at Barry's  
studio in the US or London, the need for an optimal launch timeline, a  
focused curriculum based on last year's beginner and intermediate buyer  
data, and a target on experiential learning and quick wins.


Suggested next steps


Jaideep Chagger will study the calendar and get back to the team tomorrow  
with an answer on whether the AI Summit dates of March 6, 7, and 8 should  
be changed, taking into account US spring break dates.

Jaideep Chagger will continue working on and around page optimization, copy  
play, and testing.

Jaideep Chagger will work to implement a scarcity element for the  
breakthrough guarantee to push sales and not rely on last-minute purchases.

Janja will create new products, or have Celia do it, for the three separate  
modules of the mastery program, with prices set at $1999 for non-members  
and $1499 for members.

Jaideep Chagger will create an Excel sheet with the numbers for the  
installment plans for the three separate modules, calculating an additional  
$200-$300 per payment plan, and share it with Janja.

Jaideep Chagger will create the sales pages for the three separate modules  
by taking components of the current page and adjusting the content to the  
particular curriculum part, and inform the team when they are ready for the  
sales team to use.

Janja will provide Jaideep Chagger with the email addresses of all  
customers who bought the AI Mastery last year.

Jaideep Chagger will look into the dates of US spring break in March and  
April.

Eni Selfo and Francesca Facio Crespo will have a meeting to agree on  
post-summit changes to the curriculum, including addressing the placement  
of Chris Doe and potentially adding a second session for Marie Forlio, and  
then report back.

Jaideep Chagger will ask Tom Kirby to send the document on WhatsApp or  
Slack.
