Summary


Alignment and Cloudbot Prototype
The team initiated a discussion on increasing meeting frequency to ensure  
product alignment across four applications, spurred by a prior incident  
where incorrect features were developed due to lack of synchronization. A  
chat-only prototype of the Vibrantly app using Cloudbot was introduced,  
which generated significant excitement due to its 'mind-blowing' and  
addictive user experience.

Local Development and Troubleshooting
The primary focus shifted to setting up the local development environment,  
which required troubleshooting issues with Docker, port conflicts, and  
ensuring proper Superbase configuration. A key challenge was identified  
when the application's default port clashed with another local project,  
leading to a strong mandate for establishing team-wide application port  
consistency.

UX and AI Credibility Mandate
Executive feedback centered on immediate User Experience (UX) fixes,  
specifically demanding larger text size for the target market and  
consistent user data across all ecosystem applications. The team emphasized  
prioritizing the perfection of lab work analysis and mandated explicitly  
marketing the use of the LLM Council model to users for credibility and  
accuracy.


Suggested next steps


Shafiu Hussain will book a weekly meeting for Friday.

Fauzaan will add Vishen Lakhiani's email, vision mind valley and mind 1m,  
to the local setup for login and share a temporary key for testing the AI  
modules.

Vishen Lakhiani will move story OS because it is currently using port 5173,  
which is needed for vibrantly.

Fauzaan, Shafiu Hussain, and Ahmed Amanulla (Aman) will fix the UX of the  
vibrantly application to make the text readable for users over 50 and  
ensure Vishen Lakhiani's food logging shows up on the web.

Fauzaan, Shafiu Hussain, and Ahmed Amanulla (Aman) will add a visual and  
text explaining the LLM council model and the four AIs (Gemini, Anthropic,  
and GPT) used for blood work analysis.
