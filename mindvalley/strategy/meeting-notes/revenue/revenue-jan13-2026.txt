Summary

Jill Tan reported the January sales target is $10.3 million, with $2.6  
million achieved as of Sunday, a negative 40% year-over-year attributed to  
the lack of a large future human mastery bundle sale this year. Janja  
provided updates on Masteries and Certifications, noting year-to-date  
mastery sales at $791K adjusted for refunds and outlining upcoming  
launches, including the Certified Life Coach launch moved to February and  
the Certified Business Coach launch in April. Moniek van Waaijenburg  
reported a 20% drop in performance versus last week, primarily due to old  
ad creatives, and emphasized the need for new creative refresh and  
strategic clarity for Q2 to Q4 stock decisions, while Thomas Yap Meng Tiong  
postponed his detailed update due to the marketing team's absence, and Alex  
Dogliotti confirmed the poor performance of the social media summit was  
discussed at the Executive meeting.


Suggested next steps


Moniek van Waaijenburg will move the strategy meeting, which was supposed  
to happen today, to next week to make decisions about the stock for Q2 to  
Q4.

Moniek van Waaijenburg will copy paste Thomas Yap Meng Tiong's updates into  
next week's deck.

Moniek van Waaijenburg will focus on getting strategic clarity and selling  
a lot more stock.
